Yet , while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades . America 's war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship . Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates . For most of the past 30 years , the marriage was one of convenience . In 1960 , for example , when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period . The woman had nearly died . But U.S. intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away . Mr. Noriega 's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests . From that point on , the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian 's misadventures . The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so resourceful .
